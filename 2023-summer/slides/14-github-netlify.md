# TTP Web Development Bootcamp Summer 2023
## 13 - git, GitHub, and Netlify

---

# git

- a method of `distributed version control` for code
- allows you to save different versions
- can also rollback, branch, and fork
- also used share code and allow multiple engineers to work at the same time
- absolute `industry standard`

---

# git Vocabulary

- a `codebase` is all of the code required for a program to run
- `repo` is a place where all code and changes are saved
- short for repository
- the majority of projects have 1 `codebase` and 1 `repo`
- if loss of code is a big concern, a `codebase` can be saved to multiple `repos`

---

# GitHub

- one particular company that offers `git` services
- examples of other companies: GitLab, Bitbucket, Gitea, AWS CodeCommit
- many companies use GitHub; some might even run their own git server
- [let's create an account and explore](https://github.com/)

# Connecting Replit and GitHub

- Replit supports connecting each `repl` to a GitHub `repo`
- updates to repl can be saved to GitHub
- Replit has [a good guide](https://docs.Replit.com/programming-ide/using-git-on-Replit/connect-github-to-Replit)
- **note**: it looks more professional to send samples of your code on GitHub rather than on Replit

---

# Publishing Your Project

- `git` is only good for showing code
- unlike Replit, the code cannot be compiled or run
- need another service to accomplish it
- personal recommendation is [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
