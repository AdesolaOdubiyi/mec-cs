# TTP Web Development Bootcamp Summer 2023
## 01 - Intro and HTML

---

# Goals

- to provide a foundation in web technologies
- to develop the mindsets and habits of successful software engineers
- to provide an entry point to other TTP resources and programs

---

# Class Norms

- `regular attendance` - since our program is so condensed, each day covers a lot of material
- `participation` - our curriculum is flexible and centered around your needs; for this to work, we need to hear from you regularly!
- `access to a laptop` - you are required to attend this bootcamp from a laptop or desktop; using only a smartphone is insufficient.
- `labs` - practice is key to growth and labs are a consistent way to practice; you'll be given 2-4 labs per week

---

# Labs

- should be submitted on time
- will receive feedback and a score

| score |  meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | nothing submitted |
| 1 | fundamental concerns, should be revisited  |
| 2 | well written, successful code |
| 3 | exceptional code |

---

# Structure

- morning session with guided instruction
- lunch
- afternoon coding labs

# Ice Breakers
## Type your answers into chat and we'll discuss!

---

# What technology are you most excited by?

---

# What is the most interesting country or city that you've been to?

---

# Which NYC borough is the best?

---
# The Backbone Technologies of the Web

- `HTML` (HyperText Markup Language) structures web content and assigns meaning
- `CSS` (Cascading Stylesheets) styles web content and controls how it is displayed
- `Javascript` (Javascript) amplifies web content and provides interactions

We'll be learning all 3 during this bootcamp, starting with HTML!

---

# Intro to Replit

- replit will be our primary `IDE` for the bootcamp
- provides all the tools you need 
- will be primary way you submit labs
- let's get everyone set up!

# What is HTML

HTML is a markup language that tells browsers how to structure the content you receive from websites. It indicates what roles and meanings different parts have, such as the `title`, the `navigation bar`, `images`, `forms`, and more.

---

# HTML Tags

HTML accomplishes this by using `tags`. These generally come in pairs: an opening tag and its corresponding closing tag. Everything in between gets assigned a particular meaning by the browser.

```
<h1>
  How to Bathe a Cat
</h1>

<ol>
  <li>
    Don't.
  </li>
</ol>
```

---

# HTML Syntax

There are rules for writing the HTML markup language; this is called its syntax.

An `opening tag` **must**:
- start with a `<` and end with `>`
- immediately follow the `<` with the tag's name
- optionally include more information between the tag's name and `>`

A `closing tag` **must**:
- start with a `</` and end with `>`
- immediately follow the `</` with the tag's name
- include **nothing** else

---

# Fail Safe vs Fail Danger

- web technologies are generally `fail tolerant`; if there is an error, they will try to continue as best they can
- other technologies can be `fail strict`; if there is an error, they will stop or abort. languages like C++ are `fail strict`

---

# HTML Syntax Examples

| opening tag | closing tag | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<p>` | `</p>` | paragraph |
| `<strong>` | `</strong>` | important information |
| `<h1>` | `</h1>` | header, 1st level |
| `<h2>` | `</h2>` | header, 2nd level |
| `<h3>` | `</h3>` | header, 3rd level |
| `<img />` | | image |
| `<br />` | | line break |

---

# Whitespace in HTML

Tags are critical in HTML. Anything that's not inside a tag will get `rendered` as a single line of text. For example, how do you think this poem by William Carlos Williams will be rendered?

```
I have eaten
the plums
that were in
the icebox

and which
you were probably
saving
for breakfast

Forgive me
they were delicious
so sweet
and so cold
```

---

# Summary

- HTML gives structure and meaning to content
- HTML uses `tags` that have a specific `syntax`
- Without tags, content gets `rendered` as a single line of text

---

# Pause for Questions

---

# Reading APIs and Guides

- technology changes so quickly that an `indisposable skill` is to know how to read an `api`
- `api`, or *application programming interface*, is basically the user's manual for a programming language or guide
- you can stay up to date on existing technologies and/or teach yourself new ones as they come out

---

# W3Schools Tutorials and References

- [W3Schools Tutorials](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) are divided into topics that each cover a handful of tags
- [W3Schools References](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp) has every single tag in a searchable list
- if you know what you want to do, you can search through these guides to learn the `tags`, `syntax`, and `examples`
- if you have free time, you can browse through this (or any other api) in search of anything to interesting to play with. these can be incorporated into your existing projects or even spark a new project.

# Hear ye! Hear ye!

- let's practice adding HTML tags to content so that it is rendered better by a browser
- [fork this repl](https://replit.com/@jonchin/TTP-2023-Summer-Hear-Ye-Hear-Ye). it contains excerpts from the New York Times, but only the text. your task is to wrap the text with HTML tags to make it look more like a news website.

---

# Submission Process

- generate a `join link` in replit
- submit the `join link` to this [Airtable form](https://airtable.com/shr5M7j9Rq7ewyrZC)
- be sure to select the correct response to `student` and `lab`!
