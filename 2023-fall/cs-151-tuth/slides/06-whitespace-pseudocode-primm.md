# 06 - Whitespace, Pseudocode, and PRIMM
2023-09-26

---

# Review
## What is 1 thing you remember from our last class?

- truncation - lose data due to going from higher precision data type to lower
- char - represents a single digit / letter
  - uses '
- strings - a collection of chars
  - uses "
- commenting - sometimes, too many comments can sometimes get in the way of seeing the code
- floats - decimals, 7 spaces / memory
- doubles - decimals, 14 spaces / memory
- long - allocates more space
- be precise about steps, layout variables in order
- pre-planning the steps, doing math in head, PRIMM
- PRIMM - Predict, Run, Investigate, Modify, Make
- PRIMM is a process to learn how to code
- L symbol in syntax
  - profit / 3 vs profit / 3.0
  - same thing with 3 and 3L

# Whitespace as a Tool

- whitespace includes but is not limited to: space character, tab character, new line, indenting
- breaks up code that would otherwise be a **wall of text**
- form of organization and commenting
- helps make code easier to debug
- replit can do some of this automatically for you!
  - called auto formatting

# Review / Continue Slides from Last Week

- strings, chars, and bools

---

# Psuedocode

- for complex problems, it can be easier to outline a solution
- also, if working with other programmers, sometimes need to express thoughts quickly
- writing C++ code can take too long
- instead, write `psuedocode` which is a mix of real code and English / any language
- think of it as shorthand, a plan, an approach, an outline

---

# Psuedocode Example

```
/*
ask user for new password
if too short or long, show error
ask user to enter again
if new != confirm, show error
else set password
*/
```

---

# Pros of Psuedocode

- can help catch logic errors early
- faster to write than code
- can be independent of language

---

# Cons of Psuedocode

- is not actually code; cannot run
- no standards so everyone's looks different

---

# Practice
## Use Algorithm Workbench in textbook

---

# Coding Lab
## remember PRIMM!

---

# For Next Week

- read Chapter 3.1-3.5
- review the slides
- programming assignment due next week
- quiz next week
