# Review
## name 1 thing you remember from last class

- procedural programming - top to bottom approach where statements are executed in order
  - made to use functions
  - exceptions for `control flow`, such as loops and functions
- object oriented programming - use objects to contain data
  - organizing code to use collections of variables and functions that are related in some way
- `class` - blueprint containing public and private members
  - a template that contains the design
  - a "student class" that has a public "id number" member
  - when defining a class, generally start with a capital letter
- `object` - a collection of variables and functions that are related in some way
  - an `instance` of a class
  - an instance is an example of a class
  - an individual creation of a class (blueprint) that can have variations

# Important Concepts

- `procedural programming` is ...
- `encapsulation` is keeping a bunch of variables and functions together, with some hidden and others not
  - provides security
  - achieved through private and public members
  - higher degree of organization
  - easier to manage because objects organize themselves
- `abstraction` simplifies code
  - hides low level, fine grain details
- a `class` in C++ is ...
- `instantiation` is ...
- an `object` in C++ is ...

# Accessors and Mutators

- for added security, the best practice is to create `accessors` and `mutators`
- don't allow outside code to directly access a variable
- can build in security / verification logic in the function
- create a function as an `accessor` to return the value
- create a function as a `mutator` to modify the value
