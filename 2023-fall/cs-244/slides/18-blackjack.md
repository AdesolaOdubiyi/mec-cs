# Blackjack

- [traditional rules](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjqTIzYkGdI)
- you will only be designing a Blackjack Player
- code for the Dealer and general run of game will be provided by me
- we will be starting off with simplified rules

---

# Simplified Rules

- `Aces` are only counted as 1
  - later, when we refactor, we can allow aces to be counted as 1 or 11
- there is no betting
  - you play against the dealer and either win or lose

---

# Running Games

- your code will be played at a "table" with other student's code
- will run for X number of iterations
- top players will advance, elimination style
