# 10 - OOP Lab 2
2023-09-28

# Our Toolbox!

- we know enough about objects to start using them effectively
- will continue to expand our toolbox but slower than before
- focus on coding / building

---

# Top Level Review 1/2

- `encapsulation` - provides security
- `abstraction` - simplifies complexity
- `inheritance` - promotes code reuse
- `polymorphism` - allows more flexibility and maintability
- `extensibility` - enables code to more easily scale and extend

---

# Top Level Review 2/2

- we'll go over `inheritance` later
- already have a preview of `polymorphism` through `constructors`
- will do more on `polymorphism` later
