# 03 - Terminal and Review
2023-09-05

---

# VS Code Review

---

# Terminal

- text only way of communicating / controlling a computer
- also called `Command Line Interface` or CLI
- as opposed to a `Graphical User Interface` or GUI
- incredibly powerful, which can be good and bad
  - be VERY careful when running terminal commands
- developer focused; CLI tools are sometimes the only thing available
- when working with servers and backend development, CLI is often the only way

---

# Terminal Commands
- huge difference between Window's `command prompt` and MacOS / Linux `terminal`
- MacOS is Linux based; lots of similarity with some differences
- in my experience, MacOS / Linux  is far more common
- [fundamentals tutorial by Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Understanding_client-side_tools/Command_line)

# Quiz Review

# Review Functions 1/3

- how would you define what a function is?
- how would you explain how to use them?
  - `function signature`

---

# Review Functions 2/3

- blocks of code that can be reused with different inputs and outputs
- essentially miniature programs
- can have `arguments` or not
- can have a `return value` or not
- all (arguments, return value) must have a data type

# Review Functions 3/3

---

# Review Arrays 1/3

- how would you define what an array is?
- how would you explain how to use them?

---

# Notes

- arrays are collections of like data
- arrays are a collection of values in rows
- a collection of anything, each item can be referred to by its index
- same data type!
- arrays are ordered
- arrays are variables that have multiple values
- to access an item inside, use square bracket notation
- declare an array: `int numbers[10]`;
- indexes start at 0


---

# Review Arrays 2/3

- arrays are continuous blocks in memory that hold many of the same data type
- used with an index to locate exact block you want
- index starts at 0
- be careful with `out of bounds` errors
- be careful not to access uninitialized blocks

# Algorithms

- a way of methodically solving a problem
- should be flexible enough to solve a variety of inputs
- a common approach is to solve a small part of the problem, then run the same algorithm on the smaller remaining part of the problem

---

# Algorithms Practice

- Find the largest number in an array of 1, 10, 100, and 1000 numbers
- Sort an array of 1000 numbers

# For next week

- read Chapter 7.1 - 7.4
- Programming Assignment 02 will be posted; due next week
- please at least skim through it and the chapters before Thursday's class
- bring in questions for Thursday's lab
