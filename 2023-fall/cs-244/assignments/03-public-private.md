# Programming Assignment 03 Public and Private Class Members

## PURPOSE

To practice thinking in the OOP paradigm and to practice writing class definitions in C++.

## TASK

You've been contracted out to build software for a hospital. As any good coder would do, you want to consider the needs and restrictions of the context before you design anything and certainly before you start coding. You've decided to start out by modeling the `Patient` and `Doctor` classes.

1. Think of 3 `public` and 3 `private` members that a `Patient` class might have. In a comment in your `.cpp` file, write down what these members are and why you think they should be `public` and `private`.

2. Write valid C++ code that defines the `Patient` class, with the members you described in the previous step.

3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 but for doctors instead of patients.

## SUBMISSION

Please submit a `.cpp` file on Blackboard.
