# Programming Assignment 01 Looping Review

## PURPOSE

Our course, Object Oriented Programming, dives into some complicated C++ code and concepts. To improve our chances of success, we'll spend the first few classes reviewing major concepts from CS 151. For this assignment, you'll review `looping`.

## TASK

Write a `.cpp` file that, when compiled and executed, will do the following:

1. print out all even numbers between 1 and 20 using a `for` loop
2. using a `while` loop, prompt the user to enter a number. keep prompting the user to enter a number until they enter the number 99

## EXPECTED OUTPUT

```

Enter a number: 4
Enter a number: 832
Enter a number: 13
Enter a number: 16
Enter a number: 99
thank you!
```

## SUBMISSION

Please submit a `.cpp` file on Blackboard.
