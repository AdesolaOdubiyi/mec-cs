# CS 244 - Object Oriented Programming and Design

## Course Details
Instructor: Jon Chin
3 credits; 3.5 class hours  
Tuesdays and Thursdays 12:30PM - 2:10PM EST  
Zoom and Academic Building 1 Room C09

## Course Description
	
This course presents an object-oriented approach to software development used in large-scale programming projects. A software engineering methodology, such as the Unified Modeling Language (UML), will be used for object, dynamic, and functional modeling. Students learn how to implement a system using an appropriate object oriented programming language. Programming topics include: Classes and data abstraction, operator overloading, inheritance, virtual functions and polymorphisms, templates, exception handling, and class libraries including GUI applications.

## Course Requirements
All students have the responsibility to arrive on time, attend class regularly, and to participate fully in the work of the course. Attendance will be recorded and reported. Additionally, students are not to work on other materials in class. Assigned readings, problems and programs should be completed before class.

## Textbook

We will be using `Starting Out with C++: Early Objects, 10th edition by Gaddis, Walters, and Muganda, 2020, ISBN-13: 978-0-13-523500-3`

## Grading Procedure
Check with the college catalog for information regarding the official grading policy. There will be a midterm exam around week 9 and a final exam at the end of the course. The exact dates will be announced.

Your final grade will be determined based on exams, quizzes, assignments, attendance, and participation, as follows:

| Component | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Attendance and Participation | 10% |
| Quizzes | 15% |
| Assignments | 25% |
| Midterm Exam | 25% |
| Final Exam | 25% |

## Quizzes

You will receive 1 short quiz per week at the start of class. They will be 5 multiple choice questions, all worth 1 point. It is designed as checkpoint and review rather than an assessment of your comprehension. You must be present in class in order to receive credit.

## Programming Assignments

Programming Assignments will require you to write C++ code that solves a particular task or problem. You will generally receive one Programming Assignment per week with 7 days to complete it. They are graded on a 10 point scale:

| Criteria | Points Awarded |
| --- | --- |
| Solves primary problems | 0-6 |
| Has well written comments | 0-2 |
| Compiles and runs | 0-1 |
| Makes a legitimate effort | 0-1 |
| Total | 10 |

Late submissions will incur a 0.5 point penalty per 24 hours. **No submissions will be accepted after 7 days and will be marked as a 0.**

## Grading Adjustments

At the end of the semester, prior to calculating your final grade, the lowest scoring quizz and programming assignment will be dropped. Any missing quizzes or assignments will be marked as a 0, automatically making it the lowest grade.

## Major Exams

The Midterm and Final exams will cover the first and second half of material for the semester; the Final exam will require some knowledge of the first half of the semester but will mostly focus on everything new since then. The exams will be held in class and marked on the same 10 point scale as your assignments. Make ups for these exams cannot be given except in extenuating circumstances accompanied by a doctor's note.

## Grades of Incomplete (INC)

INC grades are at the discretion of the instructor and only given in very specific circumstances.

## Academic Integrity

Students are required to adhere to the college's policy on academic integrity. This can be found on the college's website [here](https://mec.catalog.cuny.edu/academic-requirements-regulations-policies/academic-integrity-policy). For our class, this policy is extended to include copying from generative AI resources, such as ChatGPT. Any form of cheating during an exam or quiz will cause immediate removal from the exam and a grade of zero.

If you feel behind or lost in class, let me know and I can provide you with extra resources based on your needs.

### Homework Assignments

Unless otherwise specified, homework assignments are to be completed individually. Discussions with other people about how to solve the problem, strategies, or problems that might arise, are permitted. However, each person should write his/her own programs independently.
Do not, under any circumstances, copy another person's code. Incorporating someone else's code into your program in any form will be considered plagiarism and therefore a violation of academic regulations. You must be prepared to explain any program code you submit. When a student is unable to explain the working of a piece of code that he/she submitted, no credit will be given for the homework. At the discretion of the professor, the action might be reported to the Department and the Office of Student Affairs.
