2023-08-26

---

# Personal Introduction

- teaching at Medgar for about 4 years
- teaching in CUNY for 13 years, mostly in English Grammar and Composition
- run a tech non profit that focuses on food security called [Share Meals](sharemeals.org)
- backround in databases, frontend development, backend development, natural language processing, and server management
- learning and growing in machine learning, data science, and mechatronics

---

# Syllabus Review

- All important documents, including slides and our syllabus, will be available on our [GitHub](https://github.com/jonathan-chin/mec-cs)
- Let's do a quick syllabus review

---

# Class Introduction

- let's learn a bit about all of you
- what are your favorite pieces of technology (hardware or software)?
- what excites you about the future?
- what is something you enjoy or are working on that's not related to computer science?

---

# Intro to Repl.it

- [repl.it](https://replit.com) will be our primary `integrated development environment (IDE)` for this semester
- all of your coding and assignments will be done on replit
- can be a little confusing
- once you get the hang of it, it is easier to use than other development environments you'll be using later on in your career
- let's look at replit now!

---

# Programming Assignment Procedure

- Programming Assignments will be posted on repl
- you will have to `fork` them to create a copy you can edit and add your answers
- once done, you need to `generate a join link` for submission
- I'll be able to add feedback directly to your repl

---

# How to use Repl

- [Forking a repl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJSWW2uDx5Y) provided by YouTube Channel Mr. Hamilton

# Pause for questions

---

# Cognitive model of a computer
## If you had to explain what a computer is, what would you say?

---

- a machine that stores data and displays data
- a machine that can process data
- takes in information, allows it to be readable by other means
- processing is taking in input, compile it, and print it out
- computer shows it to you
- compiling is taking a language and putting into machine language
- taking a lot of information and putting it into one spot

---

# io

- the core of computer programs is in a simple 3 step process:
1. receive `input`; this can be keyboard presses, mouse movement, voice commands, physical switches, triggers from other programs, or anything else
2. transform or `process` data; this can be creating new information or changing existing information
3. produce an `output`; this can be images on your screen, sounds through your speakers, electrical signals to your printer, or anything else
- this workflow is typically called io; hen we write programs, we'll have to code each step of this process

# Writing Code

---

# English Syntax

- see if you can understand the following sentences:

1. She don't study german on Mondays.
2. he doesnt teach math
3. Mybrother is supposed totake out the trash.
4. We love to watch bsktbll.
5. julietalksveryfast

---

# English (and human) languages have forgiving syntax

# Computer languages `do not`

---

# C++ syntax and assignment submissions

- our focus this semester is a deep dive into C++ syntax
- for now, let's do an exploratory look at a [simple C++ program](https://replit.com/@jonchin/2023-01-25-Hello-World).

---

# Coding Lab

---

# The Basics

- `boilerplate` code is prewritten, minimal code that is commonly needed
- remember: computer language syntax is `not` forgiving
- one common way to `output` information is using `std::cout`

---

# Variables

- computers deal with lots of different bits of information
- these bits need to be stored somewhere
- your computer has `virtual boxes` that can be used to store info
- in programming, these are referred to as `variables`
- you'll learn more about this in depth later

# For Next Week

- read Chapter 1
- quizzes will start next week
