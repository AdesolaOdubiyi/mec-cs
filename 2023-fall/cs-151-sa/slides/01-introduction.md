---

# Syllabus Review

- All important documents, including slides and our syllabus, will be available on our [GitHub](https://github.com/jonathan-chin/mec-cs)
- Let's do a quick syllabus review

---

# Class Introduction

- let's learn a bit about all of you
- what are your favorite pieces of technology (hardware or software)?
- what excites you about the future?
- what is something you enjoy or are working on that's not related to computer science?

---

# Intro to Repl.it

- [repl.it](https://replit.com) will be our primary `integrated development environment (IDE)` for this semester
- all of your coding and assignments will be done on replit
- can be a little confusing
- once you get the hang of it, it is easier to use than other development environments you'll be using later on in your career
- let's look at replit now!

---

# Programming Assignment Procedure

- Programming Assignments will be posted on the team repl
- you'll submit them through repl
- I'll be able to add feedback directly to your repl
- reminders will be posted on Blackboard

# Pause for questions

# Cognitive model of a computer
## If you had to explain what a computer is, what would you say?

---

# io

- the core of computer programs is in a simple 3 step process:
1. receive `input`; this can be keyboard presses, mouse movement, voice commands, physical switches, triggers from other programs, or anything else
2. transform or `process` data; this can be creating new information or changing existing information
3. produce an `output`; this can be images on your screen, sounds through your speakers, electrical signals to your printer, or anything else
- this workflow is typically called io; hen we write programs, we'll have to code each step of this process

# Writing Code

# English Syntax

- see if you can understand the following sentences:

1. She don't study german on Mondays.
2. he doesnt teach math
3. Mybrother is supposed totake out the trash.
4. We love to watch bsktbll.
5. julietalksveryfast

# English (and human) languages have forgiving syntax

# Computer languages `do not`

---

# C++ syntax and assignment submissions

- our focus this semester is a deep dive into C++ syntax
- for now, let's do an exploratory look at a [simple C++ program](https://replit.com/@jonchin/2023-01-25-Hello-World).
