# 06 - Whitespace, Pseudocode, and PRIMM
2023-10-07

---

# Midterm

- Oct 28
- in class, designed for 1-1.5 hours
- will do a last minute review right before
- will be structured like an assignment
- covers material up to (and including) chapter 4*
  - might only cover parts of chapter 4 depending on time

---

# Review
## What is 1 thing you remember from our last class?

- `char` - represents a single character
  - examples: `'a'`
- `int`, `float`, `double` have different levels of precision
  - be careful of `truncation`
- `int` is a whole number, can be positive, negative, or zero
- `float` and `double` are numbers with decimals
- `bool` is true or false
- choosing the correct data type is important
- `double` as more significant digits than `float`
- `string` is a ordered collection of `char`
- `char` are based on ASCII

# Whitespace as a Tool

- whitespace includes but is not limited to: space character, tab character, new line, indenting
- breaks up code that would otherwise be a **wall of text**
- form of organization and commenting
- helps make code easier to debug
- replit can do some of this automatically for you!
  - called auto formatting

# Review / Continue Slides from Last Week

- strings, chars, and bools

---

# Psuedocode

- for complex problems, it can be easier to outline a solution
- also, if working with other programmers, sometimes need to express thoughts quickly
- writing C++ code can take too long
- instead, write `psuedocode` which is a mix of real code and English / any language
- think of it as shorthand, a plan, an approach, an outline

---

# Psuedocode Example

```
/*
ask user for new password
if too short or long, show error
ask user to enter again
if new != confirm, show error
else set password
*/
```

---

# Pros of Psuedocode

- can help catch logic errors early
- faster to write than code
- can be independent of language

---

# Cons of Psuedocode

- is not actually code; cannot run
- no standards so everyone's looks different

---

# Practice
## Use Algorithm Workbench in textbook

---

# Coding Lab
## remember PRIMM!

---

# For Next Week

- read Chapter 3.1-3.5
- review the slides
- programming assignment due next week
- quiz next week
