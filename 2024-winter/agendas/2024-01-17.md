# Hiring Anecdote

- applicants without a GitHub were automatically dismissed
- were only asked for 2-3 `repos` but I also looked at their GitHub profile
  - a `repo` is basically a project
- I did a spot check on random files to see coding habits, etc
- for this intermediate to advanced position, I was looking for projects that obviously weren't just tutorials
- for this particular project, I looked specifically for the ReactJS language

# GitHub Tour

# GitHub Account

- create one if you don't have it!
- begin using it for everything coding related
  - you can start using it for the supplementary problems
- some applicants didn't have any `public` repos to share
  - important to have hobbies / side projects
