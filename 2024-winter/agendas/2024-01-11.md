- will also start learning about `A` in `STARR`

# Coding Interviews

- remember: the goal is to demonstrate your thought process
  - not necessarily your `hard skills`, eg if you remember how to do a substring in python
- will ask you to write code but will be `white board`
  - on an actual whiteboard, on a paper, or on a bare basic Notepad like program
  - no IDE! they don't care about syntax errors etc

---

# STARR

- `S`ituation
  - describe the problem
  - rephrase it
  - give your own examples
  - ASK QUESTIONS
- `T`ask
  - give a high level of how you'd solve it
  - don't be afraid to use jargon

---

# Action

- the next step is `A`ction
- this is where you'd code it
- could just be psuedocode
- often, the actual language you use doesn't matter
