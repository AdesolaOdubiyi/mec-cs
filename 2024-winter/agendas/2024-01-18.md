# Review of STARR method

- `S`ituation - what is the problem
- `T`ask - high level overview
- `A`ction - the code itself!
- `R`eview - go over what you've been able to complete

---

# Reflect

- the last step is `R`eflect
- how might you do this problem differently?
- how might you make it more efficient (space/time complexity)?
- could you have simplified the code?
- interviewer might ask an extension
  - eg: what if you were given an input of 1,000 items? how would it run?
- no need to write new code; just talk about it
