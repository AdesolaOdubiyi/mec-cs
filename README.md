# Medgar Evers College of CUNY
## Computer Science

This repo is a collection of all the resources for CS courses taught at Medgar Evers. This includes syllabi, slides, assignments, and more.

## slides

All lecture slides are written in markdown with the intention to be converted to other presentation mediums (pdfs, Google Slides) using [MARP](https://marp.app/). Since they are markdown by default, the should still be readable on GitHub and other platforms in case MARP is unavailable.
