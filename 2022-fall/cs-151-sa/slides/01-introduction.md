# Syllabus Review

All important documents, including slides and our syllabus, will be available on our [GitHub](https://github.com/jonathan-chin/mec-cs).

Let's do a quick syllabus review.

# Intro to Repl.it

[Repl.it](https://replit.com) will be our primary `development environment` for this semester. All of your coding and assignments will be done on replit.

If you've never used something like replit before, it can be a little confusing. But once you get the hang of it, it is easier to use than other development environments you'll be using later on in your career.

Let's look at replit now!

# Checkpoint Assignment Procedure

- Checkpoint Assignments will be posted on repl. You will have to `fork` them to create a copy you can edit and add your answers.
- These are written in a specific, lightweight language called `markdown`. Markdown has its own syntax that you don't need to 100% learn or understand.
- All of your answers should be written between the three ` ``` ` marks. In general, you can keep your answers short (`2-3 sentences`).
- Once done, you need to `generate a join link`. This is is what you will submit.
- I'll be able to add feedback directly to your Repl.

# Programming Assignment Procedure

- Programming Assignments will follow the most of the same procedures as Checkpoint Assignments.
- However, instead of markdown, you will be writing in `c++`

# Cognitive model of a computer
If you had to explain what a computer is, what would you say?

# IO

The core of computer programs is in a simple 3 step process:

1. Receive `input`. This can be keyboard presses, mouse movement, voice commands, physical switches, triggers from other programs, or anything else.
2. Transform or `process` data. This can be creating new information or changing existing information.
3. Produce an `output`. This can be images on your screen, sounds through your speakers, electrical signals to your printer, or anything else.

This workflow is typically called io. When we write programs, we'll have to code each step of this process.

# English Syntax

See if you can understand the following sentences:

1. She don't study german on Mondays.
2. he doesnt teach math
3. Mybrother is supposed totake out the trash.
4. We love to watch bsktbll.
5. julietalksveryfast

# English (and human) languages have forgiving syntax.

# Computer languages `do not`

# c++ syntax

We'll do a deep dive into c++ syntax later on. For now, let's do an exploratory look at a [simple c++ program](https://replit.com/@jonchin/2022-fall-cs-151-sa-program-2-1).
