# Practice C++ Problems

## Min and Max Temperatures

Ask the user for 5 days worth of temperatures. Then, print out the min and max temperatures. You should use at least 1 array and 2 for loops.

## Fibonacci Sequence

In math, a Fibonacci Sequence is a special list of numbers that follow a particular pattern: any number is the sum of the two previous numbers in the list. A true Fibonacci Sequence starts with the same two numbers: 1, 1. Here is an example:

1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55

Write a C++ program that asks users for a number of elements they want to see. This number must be >= 2. Then, ask the user for the first 2 numbers that they want their sequence to start with. Fill out the rest of the array according to the Fibonnacci Sequence rules and print it out.

You should use at least 1 array and 3 for loops.

## Grading on a Curve

There are many strategies to help students achieve a respectable final grade by dropping or replacing some of the lowest grades.

Write a C++ program that asks a user to enter in 7 grades with values between 0-100. Then, replace the lowest grade with a 100. Finally, print out the user's average grade with this new set of scores.

You should use at least 3 for loops and at least 1 array.

## Name Registery

There are some common practices among some cultures that can lead to people having very long or very short names. Some cultures only have a first and last name. Some can have 4: first name, middle name, mother's maiden name, and father's last name.

Write a C++ program that asks the user to enter their full name, one section at a time. At most, they should be able to enter 4. If at any time they have no more names to enter, they can type "done". Finally, print out all of the names they entered in the order you received them.

You should use at least 1 array, at least 1 for loop, and potentially 1 or more while loops.


## Carnival Ride Tickets

You are building an interface to allow a parent to buy carnival rides for their children. There are certain restrictions, however:

Children must be at least 50 inches tall
A maximum of 10 tickets can be purchased at a time

Write a C++ program that asks the user to enter the heights of their children, one at a time, all in inches. If the user enters 10 heights, stop asking them. If the user types in -1, stop asking them. Then, go through all of the heights entered and count only those that are valid. Finally, print out the total number of tickets the user can purchase.

You should use at least 1 array, at least 1 for loop, and possibly 1 or more while loops.
