# review

- ordered vs sorted
  - order - sequence in which elements are added / subtracted
  - sorted - possibly reorders an array
- logic vs runtime vs compile error
- order of operations
  - just use parentheses
- functions
  - little programs within a program that can be called later on
  - how to write a function
  
- cmath library
  - pow
  - sqrt


# equal sign operator

- = is the assignment operator. it changes the values of variables
- == is the comparison operator. it checks if LHS and RHS are equal
  - example: 4 == 5
  - college == "medgar"
  - current_country == birth_country
