## Course Overview
This course provides an overview of the key paradigms used in modern programming languages and illustrates those paradigms with several programming languages. It also provides sufficient formal theory to demonstrate the role of programming language design in the context of the general computer science research agenda.

## Course Objectives
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
1. Explain the differences between the various programming paradigms and applicability of these paradigms to different programming problems.
2. Be able to develop programs using different programming languages and paradigms.
3. Be able to evaluate strengths and weaknesses of different programming languages in specific application contexts.

## Honor Code and Plagiarism

All work submitted must be your own. Do not, under any circumstances, copy your homework from the Internet or from a classmate. Do not submit programs that you did not write. Discussions with other people or Internet searches about how to solve the problem, strategies, or problems that might arise, are permitted and even encouraged. However, each student should write his/her own work, quizzes, and programs independently. Students are encouraged to ask the professor for help if they are struggling with any homework. At the discretion of the professor, any action of plagiarism might be reported to the Department and the Office of Student Affairs.

Students are required to sign and adhere to the departmental honor pledge. Check with the department for a copy of the pledge.
