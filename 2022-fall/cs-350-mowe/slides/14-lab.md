# FP & OOP

- Functional Programming is not Object Oriented Programming
  - Different designs and philosophies
  - Analogy: different countries have different forms of government
	- each has their pros and cons
	- some countries are more "successful"
	- each country has to consider its unique needs

# Best Practices

- Treat your arguments as immutable, even if they are not
- FP doesn't use any kind of loops - `for`, `while`
  - `map()`, `reduce()`, `forEach()`, or `recursion` instead
- JS treats Objects specially; they are called by reference by default
- in FP, **most** functions should return something
- The word 'object' can sometimes mean different than Object in Object Oriented Programming
  - JS object is a named collection of variables. It is analogous to Python dictionary. It is just a data type.
  - OOP Object is the concept of a self-organizing, self-managing unit. It is a concept that uses the `class` data type.
