# What is paradigm?
How would you explain it?

# A paradigm is a pattern, model, or design of how to do something

# In Programming

We'll be looking at two different paradigms:
- `Object Oriented Programming (OOP)`
- `Functional Programming`

across two languages:

- `Javascript (JS)`
- `Python`

Each has its own pros and cons. Before we can choose the best tool for any particular job, we need to know their pros and cons pretty well.

# Review: OOP
How would you explain what it is?

# Key OOP Concepts

1. `Abstraction` - hides complexity
2. `Encapsulation` - protects and prevents
3. `Inheritance` - uses existing wheels
4. `Polymorphism` - simplifies and

# Key features of OOP

- `Classes` are blueprints for objects, what they contain, how they manage themselves, and how they can be interacted with
- `Methods` are functions that objects can call, internally and externally
- `Fields` are variables that 
- `Objects` are instances of classe and represent 
- `Public` and `Private` methods / fields define how they can be accessed internally and externally

# OOP in JS

JS uses much of the same c++ syntax to create achieve OOP. You can use the `class` and `new` keywords, along with a few others: `extends` and the `#` prefix.

We won't focus too much on this since we won't be learning OOP. For our course, we will using it as reference and comparison to functional programming.
