# 01 OOP DND

## Purpose

This semester, we'll be learning functional programming and how to assess different programming paradigms. In order for us to appreciate the pros and cons of functional programming, we'll rely on our previous knowledge of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) to provide contrast. This assignment will help refresh our memory of it.

## Task

You are to write the classes necessary to play a game of Dungeons and Dragons using OOP. In particular, you need:

- create a `Player` class that has
  - name
  - race
  - gender
  - team
  - hitpoints
  - items (represented by an array of strings)

- create a `Monster` class that has
  - name
  - race
  - hitpoints

- make sure a `Player` can
  - say their name
  - say their race
  - say their gender
  - say their hitpoints
  - take damage
  - die
  - attack a monster for 1 damage
  - pick up an item from a dead Monster
  - team up with other Players

- make sure a `Monster` can
  - say their name
  - say their race
  - say their hitpoints
  - take damage
  - attack a player for 1 damage
  - die and drop an item

## Requirements

1. This must be written in Javascript / NodeJS
2. This must use OOP
