# CS 151 - Introduction to Computing

## Course Details
Instructor: Jon Chin, email TBD
3 credits; 3 class hours  
Mondays and Wednesdays 6:20pm - 8:00pm EST  
via Zoom

## Course Description
This is a course in fundamental computing principles for students with little to no computing background. This course introduces the fundamental concepts of the discipline of computing, emphasizing elementary facts concerning computer architecture, programming languages, software methodology, and algorithms. Students learn how to solve problems using C++, a high-level programming language. Programming topics include: basic data organization: arrays and lists; programming constructs: sequencing, selection, and iteration; and modularization using functions.

## Course Requirements
All students have the responsibility to arrive on time, attend class regularly, and to participate fully in the work of the course. Attendance will be recorded and reported. Additionally, students are not to work on other materials in class. Assigned readings, problems and programs should be completed before class. We will be using [repl.it](https://replit.com/) as our development environment. Please make sure you have created an account.

## Textbook

We will be using `Starting Out with C++: Early Objects, 10th edition by Gaddis, Walters, and Muganda, 2020, ISBN-13: 9780135241004`

## Grading Procedure
Check with the college catalog for information regarding the official grading policy. There will be a midterm exam around week 9 and a final exam at the end of the course. The exact dates will be announced.

Your final grade will be determined based on exams, assignments, attendance, and participation, as follows:

| Component | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Attendance and Participation | 10% |
| Programming Assignments | 20% |
| Checkpoint Assignments | 20% |
| Midterm Exam | 25% |
| Final Exam | 25% |

## Programming Assignments

Programming Assignments will require you to write C++ code that solves a particular task or problem. You will generally receive one Programming Assignment per week with 7 days to complete it. They are graded on a 10 point scale:

| Criteria | Points Awarded |
| --- | --- |
| Solves primary problems | 0-3 |
| Has well written comments | 0-3 |
| Identifies / solves edge cases | 0-2 |
| Makes a legitimate effort | 0-2 |
| Total | 10 |

Programming Assignments may be submitted past the due date with the following penalties:

| Days Late | Points Deduction |
| --- | --- |
| 1-2 | 2 |
| 3-4 | 4 |
| 5-6 | 6 |
| 7-8 | 8 |
| 9+ | no credit |

## Checkpoint Assignments

Checkpoint Assignments are a collection of conceptual questions taken from our textbook. You will generally receive one Checkpoint Assignment per week with 7 days to complete it. Each question is worth 2 points:

| Criteria | Total Point Value |
| --- | --- |
| Answer is fully / mostly correct | 2 |
| Answer is generally correct with some misunderstanding or error | 1 |
| Answer is mostly incorrect / missing | 0 |

Checkpoint Assignments may be submitted past the due date with the following penalties:

| Days Late | Points Deduction |
| --- | --- |
| 1-2 | 20% |
| 3-4 | 40% |
| 5-6 | 60% |
| 7-8 | 80% |
| 9+ | no credit |


## Honor Code and Plagiarism
All work submitted must be your own. Do not, under any circumstances, copy your homework from the Internet or from a classmate. Do not submit programs that you did not write. Discussions with other people or Internet searches about how to solve the problem, strategies, or problems that might arise, are permitted and even encouraged. However, each student should write his/her own work, quizzes, and programs independently. Students are encouraged to ask the professor for help if they are struggling with any homework. At the discretion of the professor, any action of plagiarism might be reported to the Department and the Office of Student Affairs.

Students are required to sign and adhere to the departmental honor pledge. Check with the department for a copy of the pledge.
