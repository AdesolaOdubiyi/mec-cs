question: is C++ a hard language? what can I expected out of it?

There is a concept of:

strongly typed programming language  
vs  
weakly typed programming language

strongly typed means more rules and restrictions  
weakly typed means less rules and restrictions

starting with a strongly typed language develops good **habits**
think of it like baseball. if you grow up playing baseball by the Major League rules, it's going to be very difficult at first. but when you're ready to play professionally, you'll be all set. compare this to if you grow up playing baseball lazily and not caring or knowing about the rules, you'll be at a huge disadvantage in the future.

type - refers to data types or kinds of variables
