# logic errors

`code review` - one programmer writes code and tags another programmer to check it. if it passes, the code gets "added" to the final product.

this is one of the benefits of `GitHub`

# questions on pseudocode

## Would writing pseudocode be practical for time-sensitive complex programs?
think of pseudocode as writing a draft for a paper.

## Are program comments a necessity if the application of pseudocode shares a somewhat similar role?
pseudocode more deals with explaining the logic / algorithm  
comments more deals with explaining the code itself


## Is psuedocode commonly used in a high proffessional setting?
yes.  
one example: sometimes not everyone on your team is an engineer / specialist  
another example: pseudocode is shorthand / shortcode within a team

## Is it okay to push code with psuedocode in a github main branch?
yes. just make sure to label it.

## What are edge cases ?
example: you have a program that runs the same way for 95% of all inputs  
the remaining 5% are edge cases.  
these are things you have to deal with specially / separately.  
another example: check if we are about to divide by 0

## can you run/execute pseudocode ?
no. pseudocode is human language and not machine / computer language

## Since tech companies like google allow applicants to use a programming language of their choice for interviews, can the applicant use pseudocode? 

generally, yes.  
usually, they are not looking for language profiency. they are looking for people with higher level concepts.  
sometimes, they will require a specific language for a specific position. in this case, pseudocode probably won't be allowed.


## Is it possible to create a ide that translate pseudocode into commonly used programming languages such as python, c++, java, and javascript?
not probable. not feasible.

## do you feel as though the demand of programmers have become oversaturated due to how available the resources to learn code is? And should CS majors worry?
1. specialization can help
2. quality helps
3. projects / portfolio helps a lot
