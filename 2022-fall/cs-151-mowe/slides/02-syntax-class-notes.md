in c++, punctuation really matters:

```
[] () {} <>
"" ; # / \
```

- some words can have special meaning in C++
- repl.it uses color to help us distinguish between them
- indentation in code helps us keep things organized

---

in addition to other kinds of commands we can have in our code, there are directives. a common one will be the `#include` directive

```
#include <iostream>
// will take the code for iostream and *include* it in ours
```

### comments

- comments are notes for programmers and are completely ignored by the computer
- comments start with `//` or can start with `/*` and end with `*/`
- think of comments are sticky notes.
