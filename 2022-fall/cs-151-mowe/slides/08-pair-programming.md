# 08 - Pair Programming
2022-10-12

# Slowing Down

- We're going to slow down a little today
- We've learned enough of the basics of coding to produce valuable programs
- We'll revisit some exercises and coding problems from previous chapters

---

# Intro to Pair Programming

- An often used strategy is called `pair programming`
- Often used in the industry with intern and/or junior developers
- 2 coders work simultaneously on the same code
- This can be junior + junior or even senior + junior developers
- Used with any programming language, not just C++

---

# Pair Programming Process

- 1 coder is the driver and 1 is the navigator
- The driver enters actual code and focuses primarily on `syntax`
- The navigator works through the logic and focuses primarily on the `pseudocode` or plan
- Both help each other out though!
  - Driver can give input on the plan
  - Navigator can review code as it is being written
- Coders switch roles after a while (eg 10 minutes, every function, etc)

---

# Pros

- Reduces fatigue. Many errors are often made because of fatigue. 2 coders means having "fresh eyes".
- Each person brings a different perspective and can lead to more creative problem solving
- Allows specialization. The partners can have different strengths and weaknesses but play off each other.
  - For example, if a program is to be written in `C++`, the navigator doesn't need to know the language and instead rely on the driver

---

# Cons
- Can take longer. 2 people are being used to solve 1 problem.
  - However, the resulting code tends to be **stronger**.

# Let's try some pair programming!
