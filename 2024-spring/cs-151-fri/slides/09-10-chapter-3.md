What is 1 thing you remember from our last class?

- data types - a class of information
  - the beginning of a computer to manipulate data
  - tells the program how to interpret the data
  - eg: when using int, you're telling the computer you're working with a number
  - boolean
  - function
  - float
  - double
  - char
  - array
  - void
  - int
  - string *
- hexadecimal (16) / octal (8) - defines number system base
- truncation / truncated values - happens when we convert from high precision to low precision
  - example: ```
	double total_people_in_bk = 8000.0;
	int total_households_in_bk = 300;
	double average_people_per_household = total_households_in_bk / total_people_in_bk;
  ```
- integer division - when dividing by an integer, there's a risk of losing decimal points

- modifiers - long, unsigned, short, long long
  - change how much memory is available to your variable
  - for our course, don't worry about them
