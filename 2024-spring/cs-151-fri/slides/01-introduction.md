# Syllabus Review

- All important documents, including slides and our syllabus, will be available on our [GitHub](https://github.com/jonathan-chin/mec-cs)
- Let's do a quick syllabus review

---

# Class Introduction

- let's learn a bit about all of you
- what are your favorite pieces of technology (hardware or software)?
- what excites you about the future?
- what is something you enjoy or are working on that's not related to computer science?

---

# Intro to Repl.it

- [repl.it](https://replit.com) will be our primary `development environment` for this semester
- all of your coding will be done on replit
- can be a little confusing at first
- once you get the hang of it, it is easier to use than other development environments you'll be using later on in your career
- let's look at repl.it now!

---

# Repl.it Code Completion

- repl.it has a `Code Completion` feature that uses generative AI that automatically fills in code based on predictions
- this is similar in use to ChatGPT and can be seen as plagiarism
- please do not use `Code Completion` for this course

---

# Submission Procedure

- Labs, Assignments, the Midterm, and the Final will be posted on repl.it
- you will have to `fork` them to create a copy you can edit and add your code
- once done, you need to `generate a join link` for submission on Blackboard
- I'll be able to add feedback directly to your repl

---

# Editing History

- much like Google Docs, repl.it keeps track of your editing history
- all code must be done in a single repl and submitted, so I can see your editing history as well
- sudden changes in code, such as the appearance of 1+ lines of code, can be indicative of plagiarism

# How to use Repl

# Pause for questions

---

# Cognitive model of a computer
## If you had to explain what a computer is, what would you say?

---

# io

- the core of computer programs is a simple 3 step process:
1. receive `input`; this can be keyboard presses, mouse movement, voice commands, physical switches, triggers from other programs, or anything else
2. transform or `process` data; this can be creating new information or changing existing information
3. produce an `output`; this can be images on your screen, sounds through your speakers, electrical signals to your printer, or anything else
- this workflow is typically called io; hen we write programs, we'll have to code each step of this process

# Writing Code

---

# English Syntax

- see if you can understand the following sentences:

1. She don't study german on Mondays.
2. he doesnt teach math
3. Mybrother is supposed totake out the trash.
4. We love to watch bsktbll.
5. julietalksveryfast

# English (and human) languages have forgiving syntax

# Computer languages `do not`

---

# C++ syntax and assignment submissions

- our focus this semester is a deep dive into C++ syntax
- for now, let's do an exploratory look at a simple c++ program

---

# Break

---

# Lab 1

Please create a new repl and copy, character for character, the following code:

```
#import <iostream>

int main(){
  std::cout << "Hello World\n";
  std::cout << "How are you doing?"'
  return 0;
}
```

---

# Lab 1

- make sure that your code `compiles` and `runs`
- submit via Blackboard
- let's go through the code line by line!

---

# Lab 2

- posted on Blackboard

---

# For Next Week

- read Chapter 1 (pages 69-135)
- quizzes will start next week (based around the first half of the chapter)
