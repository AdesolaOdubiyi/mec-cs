# Extra Notes

---

# null values

- our textbook says that `null` values are "difficult to handle and it is preferable not to resort to them"
- not necessarily true
- it is `best practice` to explicitly specify which `attributes` can have null and which cannot
- your data model **MUST** explain what a `null` value means
- example: Google Form submissions that allow/don't allow anonymous submissions

---

# transactions and atomicity

- what is transaction?
- what if your bank account has a deduction followed by deposit?

---

# Two and Three Tier Architecture

- three tier architecture is much more secure
- general practice is to assume your user is always malicious
