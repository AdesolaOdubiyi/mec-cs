# CS 281 - Database Systems

## Course Details
Instructor: Jon Chin, jonathan.chin@mec.science
3 credits; 3 class hours  
Mondays and Wednesdays 10:00am - 11:40am EST  
Academic Building 1 Room C09

## Course Description

This course provides the basis for a solid education in the fundamentals of database technology. Topics include Database Management, Database System Architecture, Relational Data Base Systems (Query Languages, Application Development Systems), Software Specific (Self Contained) and Hardware Specific (Data Base Machines). Data manipulation language studied include: SQL, relational calculus, Query-By-Example, and natural languages.

This course provides in-depth coverage of database design, demonstrating that the key to successful database implementation is in proper design of databases to fit within a larger strategic view of the data environment. With a strong hands-on component that includes real-world examples and exercises, this course will help students develop database design, implementation, and query skills that have valuable and meaningful application in the real world. The relational database to use will be sqlite and postgres.

## Course Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:
- Install, configure, and interact with a relational database management system (i.e. postgres).
- Describe, define and apply the major components of the relational database model to database design.
- Use the Structured Query Language (SQL) for database definition, manipulation, and query.
- Define, develop and manipulate single entity database tables.
- Define, develop and manipulate one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationship between single entity tables.

## Grading Procedure

Check with the college catalog for information regarding the official grading policy. There will be a midterm exam around week 9 and a final exam at the end of the course. The exact dates will be announced.

Your final grade will be determined based on exams, quizzes, assignments, attendance, and participation, as follows:

| Component | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Labs | 10% |
| Quizzes | 15% |
| Assignments | 25% |
| Midterm Exam | 25% |
| Final Exam | 25% |

## Labs

Labs will require you to write SQL code that solves a particular task or problem. Additionally, you will often be required to write a plain English explanation of the rationale you used when writing that code. They are graded on a 10 point scale:

| Criteria | Points Awarded |
| --- | --- |
| Solves primary problems | 0-5 |
| Explains code sufficiently | 0-3 |
| Runs without errors | 0-2 |
| Total | 10 |

## Assignments

Assignments are similar to Labs in that you will be required to write SQL code and rationale, only that Assignments will be more complex. You will generally receive one Assignment per week with 7 days to complete it. 

Late submissions will incur a 0.5 point penalty per 24 hours. **No submissions will be accepted after 7 days.**

## Grades of Incomplete (INC)
INC grades are at the discretion of the instructor and only given in very specific circumstances. An `INC` grade is given when the student the student is doing passing work during a semester and who for some justifiable reason has not been able to complete a single, major assignment or misses a final exam. Check the College catalog for further information regarding INC grades.

## Honor Code, Plagiarism, and Cheating

Students are required to sign and adhere to the departmental honor pledge. Check with the department for a copy of the pledge.

### Exams and Quizzes

Cell phones or any other electronic devices cannot be used during exams and quizzes. Any form of cheating during an exam or quiz will cause immediate removal from the exam and a grade of zero.

### Homework Assignments

Unless otherwise specified, homework assignments are to be completed individually. Discussions with other people about how to solve the problem, strategies, or problems that might arise, are permitted. However, each person should write his/her own programs independently.

Do not, under any circumstances, copy another person's code. Incorporating someone else's code into your program in any form will be considered plagiarism and therefore a violation of academic regulations. You must be prepared to explain any program code you submit. When a student is unable to explain the working of a piece of code that he/she submitted, no credit will be given for the homework. At the discretion of the professor, the action might be reported to the Department and the Office of Student Affairs.
