# CS 151 - Introduction to Computing

## Course Details
Instructor: Jon Chin, jonathan.chin@mec.science  
3 credits; 3 class hours  
Mondays and Wednesdays 8:15am - 9:55am EST  
Academic Building 1 Room C09

## Course Description
This is a course in fundamental computing principles for students with little to no computing background. This course introduces the fundamental concepts of the discipline of computing, emphasizing elementary facts concerning computer architecture, programming languages, software methodology, and algorithms. Students learn how to solve problems using C++, a high-level programming language. Programming topics include: basic data organization: arrays and lists; programming constructs: sequencing, selection, and iteration; and modularization using functions.

| Requirements | Course  |
| ------------ | ------- |
| Prerequesite | MTH 130 |
| Corequisites | MTH 151 |

## Course Requirements
All students have the responsibility to arrive on time, attend class regularly, and to participate fully in the work of the course. Attendance will be recorded and reported. Additionally, students are not to work on other materials in class. Assigned readings, problems and programs should be completed before class. 

## Textbook

We will be using `Starting Out with C++: Early Objects, 10th edition by Gaddis, Walters, and Muganda, 2020, ISBN-13: 978-0-13-523500-3`

## Grading Procedure
Check with the college catalog for information regarding the official grading policy. Your final grade will be determined with the following breakdown:

| Component    | Value |
| ------------ | ----- |
| Quizzes      | 10%   |
| Labs         | 15%   |
| Assignments  | 25%   |
| Midterm Exam | 25%   |
| Final Exam   | 25%   |
|              |       |
| Total        | 100%  |

Submissions for Quizzes, Labs, Assignments, the Midterm, and the Final will be done through Blackboard. No other method of submission will be accepted.


## Quizzes

Short quizzes will be given at the start of every class, within the first 20 minutes. They are designed to assess your general knowledge of the week's material but not your mastery. If you have done the assigned reading, you should be fine. You must be physically present in class in order to take the quiz. If you arrive late and the quiz is still going on, you can still take it but may not be given extra time. If you arrive late and the quiz has already finished, you have unfortunately missed it and will not be able to take it.

## Labs

One day per week will be devoted to lab work. During this time, you will work individually and sometimes in partners to complete a few programming problems. These are due before class has ended and are graded using the following rubric:

| Requirement               | Value |
| ------------------------- | ----- |
| Solves primary problems   | 0-5   |
| Has meaningful comments   | 0-3   |
| Compiles and runs         | 0-2   |
|                           |       |
| Total                     | 10    |


## Assignments

Assignments will require you to write C++ code that solves a particular task or problem. You will generally receive one Assignment per week with 7 days to complete it. They are graded on the same 10 point scale as labs.

Late submissions will incur a 0.5 point penalty per 24 hours. **No submissions will be accepted after 7 days.**

## Midterm and Final

The Midterm and Final exams will be cumulative, in person exams. You will receive a single coding problem, similar to what you've seen in Labs and Assignments, only more complex. They will be graded on the same 10 point scale as Labs and Assignments. There are no make ups for these exams.

## Grade Adjustment

To allow for some leeway in grading, your lowest score in each of the following grade components will be dropped:

- Your lowest day of labs, since we will be doing multiple labs per day
- Your lowest quiz
- Your lowest assignment

Any missing grade component is automatically graded as a 0. For example, if you miss a lab or do not submit an assignment, it will be graded as a 0.

## Generative AI

The use of generative AI, such as ChatGPT, to submit graded items for this class is considered academic dishonesty. Any submissions that demonstrate markers of generative AI are subject to verbal review; you can be asked to verbally explain your understanding of any piece of the submission. If it is still suspected that generative AI was used, appropriate action will be taken.

For Labs, Quizzes, Assignments, and the Midterm, a 0 will be given. For the Final, a failing grade will be given for the course. If repeated instances of generative AI use are observed, a failing grade will be given for the course.

## Tutoring

One on one tutoring is available for this course. This can be used to prepare for assignments and exams or to review any past assignments and exams. Details on how to sign up for tutoring will be made via Blackboard.

## Grades of Incomplete (INC)
INC grades are at the discretion of the instructor and only given in very specific circumstances. An `INC` grade is given when the student the student is doing passing work during a semester and who for some justifiable reason has not been able to complete a single, major assignment or misses a final exam. Check the College catalog for further information regarding INC grades.

## Honor Code and Plagiarism
Students are required to sign and adhere to the departmental honor pledge. Check with the department for a copy of the pledge.
