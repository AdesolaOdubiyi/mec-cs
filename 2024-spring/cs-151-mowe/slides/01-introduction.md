# Cognitive model of a computer
## If you had to explain what a computer is, what would you say?

- a tool to help you simplify your daily tasks
  - equations, writing
- a piece of technology, a program to receive and keep data
- a function - put an input, get an output
  - eg: search engine: query -> results
- tech that utilizes hardware and written softare that does a task that the user creates
- a piece of technology to react to information that is given
- data could be statistics / numbers, keyboard presses, mouse movements, button presses, electrical signals ie from wifi or the internet
- RAM, motherboards, integrated chips

# io

- the core of computer programs is a simple 3 step process:
1. receive `input`; this can be keyboard presses, mouse movement, voice commands, physical switches, triggers from other programs, or anything else
2. transform or `process` data; this can be creating new information or changing existing information
3. produce an `output`; this can be images on your screen, sounds through your speakers, electrical signals to your printer, or anything else
- this workflow is typically called io; hen we write programs, we'll have to code each step of this process
