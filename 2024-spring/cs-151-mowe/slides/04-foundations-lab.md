# Review
## What is 1 thing you remember about last class?

- high level languages need to be converted to low level languages
  - high level language - closer to human language; to make it easier for programmers to write code; eg: C++, python, Javascript, Java, PHP
  - low level language - helps the CPU process information more quickly and accurately
  - converting is compiling, which uses a special tool called a compiler
  - key difference - CPUs cannot understand high level languages but humans can't effectively write in low level languages
- CPU - brain
  - really fast working
  - very literal
  - never makes mistakes
  - mistakes are usually our fault
- RAM - scratchbook, temporary space for the CPU to do its work
  - volatile - gets lost when computer is powered down
- operators
  - different types of symbols that transform the data
  - eg: +, -, /, *, ++, --, !, &&, ||
- statements - complete instruction that can be taken action on
  - usually ends with a ;
- lines and whitespace
  - using more of these allows it to be more readable / writeable
- logic error - a mistake in reasoning but not syntax
  - it gives the wrong answer to the problem but doesn't give a compilation error
  - eg: subtracting instead of adding,  or using < instead of >
- syntax / compilation error - errors in the language
  - eg: extra bracket, missing semicolon, misspelled variables
- runtime error - when code is run in a specific circumstance / context
  - could result in crashing program / machine
  - eg: divide by 0
