# Review

- `Array` - a collection of data of the same `data type`
- declaring an array: `double days[7];`
  - note: in C++, an array's size is fixed and must be known at declaration
- reading from / accessing / indexing into an array: `std::cout << days[0];`
- writing into / mutating an array: `days[3] = 3.9;`
- often used with the "standard for loop"
  - `for(int index = 0; index < 7; index++){/* do stuff here */}`
