# 02 - Repl.it Lab
2024-01-29

---

# Review
## What is 1 thing you remember about last class?

---

# Intro to Repl.it

- [repl.it](https://replit.com) will be our primary `development environment` for this semester
- all of your coding will be done on replit
- can be a little confusing at first
- once you get the hang of it, it is easier to use than other development environments you'll be using later on in your career
- let's look at repl.it now!

---

# Repl.it Code Completion

- repl.it has a `Code Completion` feature that uses generative AI that automatically fills in code based on predictions
- this is similar in use to ChatGPT and can be seen as plagiarism
- please do not use `Code Completion` for this course

---

# Submission Procedure

- Labs, Assignments, the Midterm, and the Final will be posted on repl.it
- you will have to `fork` them to create a copy you can edit and add your code
- once done, you need to `generate a join link` for submission on Blackboard
- I'll be able to add feedback directly to your repl

---

# Editing History

- much like Google Docs, repl.it keeps track of your editing history
- all code must be done in a single repl and submitted, so I can see your editing history as well
- sudden changes in code, such as the appearance of 1+ lines of code, can be indicative of plagiarism

# Pause for questions

---

# Lab 1

Please create a new repl and copy, character for character, the following code:

```
#import <iostream>

int main(){
  std::cout << "Hello World\n";
  std::cout << "Happy Friday!";
}
```

---

# Lab 1 submission

- make sure that your code `compiles` and `runs`
- submit via Blackboard
- let's go through the code line by line!

---

# Lab 2

- posted on Blackboard

---

# For Next Week

- read Chapter 1
  - you don't have to do any of the questions if you don't want to
- quizzes will start next week
