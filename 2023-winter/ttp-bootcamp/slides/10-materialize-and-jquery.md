# Review Notes

- `CRUD` - create, read, update, delete
- jQuery event handling like `.click()`
  - `.keypress()`, `.change()`, `.load()`, `.submit()`
- using `const` for variable types is best practice
- jQuery is a JS library that DOM manipulation, event handling, traversal
  - examples of traversal are `.parent()` and `.children()`
  - `DOM` - Document Object Model, the format of all HTML elements
- `$(css_selector)`
- JS syntax is similar C, java, C++, etc
  - also known as `C-Style`
- JS is weakly typed / dynamically typed
  - variable types are not strongly enforced
  - variable types are automatically converted when needed
- JS is `Turing complete`
  - formal definition of what counts as a *machine* / *computer*
- for jQuery, you generally want all of your code inside `$(document).ready()`
  - timing / loading issues
