# 01 - Introduction to our course!
2023-01-25

---

# Syllabus Review

- All important documents, including slides and our syllabus, will be available on our [GitHub](https://github.com/jonathan-chin/mec-cs)

- Let's do a quick syllabus review

---

# Intro to Repl.it

- [repl.it](https://replit.com) will be our primary `development environment` for this semester
- all of your coding and assignments will be done on replit
- can be a little confusing
- once you get the hang of it, it is easier to use than other development environments you'll be using later on in your career
- let's look at replit now!

---

# Programming Assignment Procedure

- Programming Assignments will be posted on repl
- you will have to `fork` them to create a copy you can edit and add your answers
- once done, you need to `generate a join link` for submission
- I'll be able to add feedback directly to your Repl

# How to use Repl

# Cognitive model of a computer
## If you had to explain what a computer is, what would you say?

---

- a device working with information
- a machine that is designed to make human's lives easier in terms of programming
- a machine that reads, runs, and returns code in a visual format
- a device limited by a coder's imagination
- run - meaning to make code that's been read work, return is output
- working as in processing functions and inputs. giving visual or functional feedback
- a computer receives information usually in binary for, and is able to use this infomration to complete sequences and give data back

# io

- the core of computer programs is in a simple 3 step process:
1. receive `input`; this can be keyboard presses, mouse movement, voice commands, physical switches, triggers from other programs, or anything else
2. transform or `process` data; this can be creating new information or changing existing information
3. produce an `output`; this can be images on your screen, sounds through your speakers, electrical signals to your printer, or anything else
- this workflow is typically called io; hen we write programs, we'll have to code each step of this process

# Writing Code

# English Syntax

- see if you can understand the following sentences:

1. She don't study german on Mondays.
2. he doesnt teach math
3. Mybrother is supposed totake out the trash.
4. We love to watch bsktbll.
5. julietalksveryfast

# English (and human) languages have forgiving syntax

# Computer languages `do not`

---

# c++ syntax and assignment submissions

- our focus this semester is a deep dive into C++ syntax
- for now, let's do an exploratory look at a [simple c++ program](https://replit.com/@jonchin/2023-01-25-Hello-World).

# For Next Week

- read Chapter 1 (pages 69-135)
- quizzes will start next week (based around the first half of the chapter)
