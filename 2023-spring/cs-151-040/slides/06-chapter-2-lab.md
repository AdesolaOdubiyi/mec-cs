# Review
## What is 1 thing you remember from our last class?

- different types of errors
- logic error: code compiles and runs but is incorrect
- compile error: source code violates some rule of the language; it won't compile or run.
- runtime error: runs as intended for almost all inputs; certain inputs or circumstances produces an error
  - example: divide by zero
  - example: a program is coded and tested on a macbook. but when it runs on a windows machine, it fails.
- comments (single line `//` and multiline `/* */`)
  - writing good comments
  - think of themas highlighters or a summary of what the code is intended to do
  - explicitly explaining code to avoid confusion
- common variable name formats
  - popular format: snake case: months_of_the_years
  - popular format: camel case: lorenzoRichardson
  - special format: upper case: UPPER_CASE
  - capital case: CapitalCase
