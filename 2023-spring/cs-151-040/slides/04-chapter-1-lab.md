# Review
## What is 1 thing you remember from our last class?

- correct / incorrect variable names
  - no white space
- declaring variables
  - let the compiler know that you will be using some data
  - computer will set aside space in memory
  - `variable_type variable_name;`
  - examples: `int age;`
- variable types - determine what kind of data we have and how we can manipulate it
  - int
  - double
  - char
  - bool
  - float
  - void
  - string
- variable assignment - give a variable a value
  - uses the `=`
  - example: `age = 35;`
  - sometimes combined with declaring: `int age = 35;`
- tracing a program
  - thinking like the computer using pen and paper; helps with debugging
  - used to see the `memory state` at any particular point in the program
- user input
  - using `std::cin`

# Using your IDE

- depending on your IDE, it can provide any of the following tools:
  -`syntax highlighting` - colors to identify different parts of code including errors
  - `tooltips` - relevant snippets of the API as you type
  - `autocompletion` - suggestions of all possible and/or the most probably next things for you too type

# Read error messages

- most of the time, your compiler will tell you `exactly` what the error is
- with complex errors, sometimes you need experience knowing how to interpret them
- don't be afraid of error messages!
- run your code `often` to find errors early; run after every 1-3 lines
