## Course Details
Instructor: Jon Chin, email TBD
3 credits; 3 class hours  
Mondays and Wednesdays 6:20pm - 8:00pm EST  
Academic Building 1 and Zoom

## Course Description
This is a course in fundamental computing principles for students with little to no computing background. This course introduces the fundamental concepts of the discipline of computing, emphasizing elementary facts concerning computer architecture, programming languages, software methodology, and algorithms. Students learn how to solve problems using C++, a high-level programming language. Programming topics include: basic data organization: arrays and lists; programming constructs: sequencing, selection, and iteration; and modularization using functions.

| Prerequesite | MTH 130 |
| Corequisites | MTH 151 |

## Course Requirements
All students have the responsibility to arrive on time, attend class regularly, and to participate fully in the work of the course. Attendance will be recorded and reported. Additionally, students are not to work on other materials in class. Assigned readings, problems and programs should be completed before class. We will be using [repl.it](https://replit.com/) as our development environment. Please make sure you have created an account.

## Textbook

We will be using `Starting Out with C++: Early Objects, 10th edition by Gaddis, Walters, and Muganda, 2020, ISBN-13: 978-0-13-523500-3`

## Grading Procedure
Check with the college catalog for information regarding the official grading policy. There will be a midterm exam around week 9 and a final exam at the end of the course. The exact dates will be announced.

Your final grade will be determined based on exams, quizzes, assignments, attendance, and participation, as follows:

| Component | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Attendance and Participation | 10% |
| Quizzes | 15% |
| Assignments | 25% |
| Midterm Exam | 25% |
| Final Exam | 25% |

## Programming Assignments

Programming Assignments will require you to write C++ code that solves a particular task or problem. You will generally receive one Programming Assignment per week with 7 days to complete it. They are graded on a 10 point scale:

| Criteria | Points Awarded |
| --- | --- |
| Solves primary problems | 0-3 |
| Has well written comments | 0-3 |
| Compiles and runs | 0-2 |
| Makes a legitimate effort | 0-2 |
| Total | 10 |

Late submissions will incur a 0.5 point penalty per 24 hours. **No submissions will be accepted after 7 days.**

## Grades of Incomplete (INC)
INC grades are at the discretion of the instructor and only given in very specific circumstances. An `INC` grade is given when the student the student is doing passing work during a semester and who for some justifiable reason has not been able to complete a single, major assignment or misses a final exam. Check the College catalog for further information regarding INC grades.

## Honor Code and Plagiarism
Students are required to sign and adhere to the departmental honor pledge. Check with the department for a copy of the pledge.

### Exams and Quizzes

Cell phones or any other electronic devices cannot be used during exams and quizzes. Any form of cheating during an exam or quiz will cause immediate removal from the exam and a grade of zero.

### Homework Assignments

Unless otherwise specified, homework assignments are to be completed individually. Discussions with other people about how to solve the problem, strategies, or problems that might arise, are permitted. However, each person should write his/her own programs independently.
Do not, under any circumstances, copy another person's code. Incorporating someone else's code into your program in any form will be considered plagiarism and therefore a violation of academic regulations. You must be prepared to explain any program code you submit. When a student is unable to explain the working of a piece of code that he/she submitted, no credit will be given for the homework. At the discretion of the professor, the action might be reported to the Department and the Office of Student Affairs.
