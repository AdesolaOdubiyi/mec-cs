# Final Project Initial Thoughts

- Individual submissions but can get help from others
- Will have to submit SQL code
- May have to write a small amount of helper code in another language (eg python)
- Will be graded equally on functionality (does the code give the expected result) and design (does the database structure make sense)
- Will have to submit short text explaining rationale of design decisions
- Will have to create limited access user that I will use to attempt (light) hacking
