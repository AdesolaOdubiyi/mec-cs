# Python Review

- some things aren't accessible in SQL (host language)
  - loops are easier to do in a host
  - doesn't have variables
  - can't do user input
- virtual environment (venv)
  - keeps separate copies of libraries / packages
  - otherwise, all python scripts use shared libraries on the machine
  - prevents using the wrong library version
- tech communication
  - soft skills
  - using the appropriate level of tech-iness depending on your audience
- environment variables
