## What is 1 thing you remember from our last class?

---

# Using your IDE

- depending on your IDE, it can provide any of the following tools:
  -`syntax highlighting` - colors to identify different parts of code including errors
  - `tooltips` - relevant snippets of the API as you type
  - `autocompletion` - suggestions of all possible and/or the most probably next things for you too type

---

# Read error messages

- most of the time, your compiler will tell you `exactly` what the error is
- with complex errors, sometimes you need experience knowing how to interpret them
- don't be afraid of error messages!
- run your code `often` to find errors early; run after every 1-3 lines
