# Review
## What is 1 thing you remember from our last class?

- std::cout and std::cin
  - std::cout for output and std::cin for input (keyboard)
- variable types - define your variables
  - double - numbers with a decimal
  - float - numbers with a decimal
  - int - whole number / integer
  - bool
  - char
  - string
- variable name rules
  - can only contain letters, numbers, underscores
  - cannot use keywords
    - be careful: cannot use double but you can use Double
  - cannot start with a number
- `int main()` - the primary function that automatically gets run each time
- `#include <iostream>` - preprocessor directive that copies and pastes the library (iostream)
- `using namespace std` - allows a shortcut so we can leave out `std::`
  -  best practice to not use

# Using your IDE

- depending on your IDE, it can provide any of the following tools:
  -`syntax highlighting` - colors to identify different parts of code including errors
  - `tooltips` - relevant snippets of the API as you type
  - `autocompletion` - suggestions of all possible and/or the most probably next things for you too type

# Read error messages

- most of the time, your compiler will tell you `exactly` what the error is
- with complex errors, sometimes you need experience knowing how to interpret them
- don't be afraid of error messages!
- run your code `often` to find errors early; run after every 1-3 lines
