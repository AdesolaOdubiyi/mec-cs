# Review
## What is 1 thing you remember from our last class?

- comments
  - `//` for single line comments
  - `/* */` for multi line comments
- did some coding practice at the end
- order of code matters
  - C++ is procedural language
  - generally it starts at line 1 and continues to the end of the program, line by line
- variable name formats
  - dash `-`
  - underscore `_`
  - capitalization
  - no spaces
  - no keywords
  - popular: snake case: `current_year`
  - popular: camel case: `currentYear`
  - not so popular: capital case: `CurrentYear`
  - not so popular: uppercase: `CURRENT_YEAR`
- error types
  - `compile error` (commonly a syntax error)
    - won't compile, won't run
  - `logic error`
    - code works but doesn't do what you intended to do
  - `runtime error`
    - code generally works for except for a small subset of cases
	- user inputs 0 when doing division
- PRIMM
  - predict!

# Misc notes

- please submit your assignments as text instead of as a comment
- notes in replits: any comments I leave will always be in the form `// JC:`
- comments are required; don't have to be long, just have to be explanatory
